# 🔴⚪ Arsenal: JSON & CSV Streaming

This project streams **real-time Arsenal match data** using **Kafka**. Two types of data are processed:

- **JSON:** Match events (goals, assists, cards, substitutions).
- **CSV:** Player performance stats (passes, tackles, shots).

Both data formats are **produced, streamed, and consumed in real-time**.
